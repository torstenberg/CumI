# Assessment data for the CumI R script
This directory should contain the data which the R script CumI-assessment.Rmd is using for the assessment. Since this is an enourmous amount of data (roughly 2 GB), they have not been uploaded to Github.

Please download the Data folder from the [HELCOM EN BENTHIC workspace here](https://portal.helcom.fi/workspaces/EN-BENTHIC-191/Shared%20Documents/CumI/CumI-R/Data).

Put the downloaded Data directory alongside the R script (i.e. into the same directory) in order to use it.
